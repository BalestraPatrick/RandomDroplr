RandomDroplr
============

Just a small iPhone app developed in a few hours for fun. The app builds a random 4 characters string to generate a droplr link so every time you click next, you can see a new file. 

Pretty fun (but not always) to see what other people share with this service. 

The app is optimized for 4-inches iPhones only.

This is also an example that everything shared with a free Droplr plan is public, so be careful with what you share.

Feel free to install the app on your device to have some fun and see what people share on droplr! :)
