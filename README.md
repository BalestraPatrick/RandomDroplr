RandomDroplr
============

Just a small iPhone app developed in a few hours for fun. The app builds a random 4 characters string to generate a droplr link so every time you click next, you can see a new file. 

Pretty fun (but not always) to see what other people share with this service. 

The app is optimized 4-inches iPhones only.

I don't own any of the content which is showed on the app. Everything is loaded through a webView from the http://d.pr.i address.

This is also an example that everything shared with a free Droplr plan is public, accessible from anywhere by anyone. Please be careful :)
